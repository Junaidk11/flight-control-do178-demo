# Flight Control DO-178C Demo Project  
*A Reference Project for Safety-Critical Development Processes*  

This repository demonstrates how to develop software under **functional safety standards** such as **DO-178C** (airborne software), **ISO 26262** (automotive), **IEC 62304** (medical), and similar frameworks.  

It is structured to serve as both a **portfolio project** and a **future reference guide**.

## ðŸ“‘ Development Flow (Step by Step)

### 1. System Requirements & Safety Assessment  
- **Artifacts**: [System Requirements](docs/Requirements.md), Safety Assessment Notes  
- **Concepts**:  
  - **FHA** â€“ Functional Hazard Assessment  
  - **FTA** â€“ Fault Tree Analysis  
  - **HARA** â€“ Hazard Analysis & Risk Assessment  
- **Goal**: Identify hazards, assign safety levels (DAL C in this project).  

---

### 2. Software Planning  
- **Artifacts**:  
  - [PSAC](docs/PSAC.md) â€“ *Plan for Software Aspects of Certification*  
  - [SDP](docs/SDP.md) â€“ *Software Development Plan*  
  - [SVP](docs/SVP.md) â€“ *Software Verification Plan*  
  - [SCMP](docs/SCMP.md) â€“ *Software Configuration Management Plan*  
  - [SQAP](docs/SQAP.md) â€“ *Software Quality Assurance Plan*  
- **Goal**: Define *how* software will be developed, verified, managed, and assured.  

---

### 3. High-Level Requirements (HLR)  
- **Artifact**: [Requirements.md](docs/Requirements.md)  
- Example: *System shall maintain pitch within Â±2Â° of target.*  
- **Goal**: Translate safety/system requirements into **software-level behavior statements**.  

---

### 4. Low-Level Requirements (LLR) & Design  
- **Artifacts**: [Design Diagrams](design/ArchitectureDiagram.png), State Machine  
- **Goal**: Specify module-level behavior and internal design decisions (algorithms, scheduling, interfaces).  

---

### 5. Source Code Implementation  
- **Artifacts**: [Source Code](src/) (C with MISRA-style guidelines)  
- **Goal**: Implement design in a safe, consistent, and reviewable manner.  

---

### 6. Verification  
- **Artifacts**:  
  - [Unit Tests](tests/)  
  - [Coverage Reports](tests/coverage_report/)  
  - [Review Checklists & Logs](reviews/)  
- **Concepts**:  
  - **RBT** â€“ Requirements-Based Testing  
  - **Coverage** â€“ Statement, Decision, and (if applicable) MC/DC  
- **Goal**: Demonstrate that each requirement is fully verified.  

---

### 7. Integration & Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing  
- **Artifacts**: HIL Test Notes (future extension)  
- **Goal**: Validate system integration and real-time performance on hardware.  

---

### 8. Certification Evidence & Deliverables  
- **Artifacts**: [Traceability Matrix](docs/TraceabilityMatrix.xlsx), Test Reports  
- **Goal**: Show end-to-end traceability (HLR â†’ LLR â†’ Code â†’ Test) and compliance with DO-178C objectives.
